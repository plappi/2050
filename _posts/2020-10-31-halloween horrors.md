Perhaps today is a good day to raise this blog from the dead. Here's one halloween horror and one nice book:

1. [Academic publishing](https://transformativelearning.nl/2018/12/04/publish-and-perish-how-the-commodification-of-scientific-publishing-is-undermining-both-science-and-the-public-good/);

2. [Fallout](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/561465/fallout-by-fred-pearce/) by Fred Pearce. I particularly liked the chapter "Millisieverts: a dose of reason".
