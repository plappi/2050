Policy makers have redesigned the so-called Market Stability Reserve of the EU ETS apparently to tackle the surplus of permits in the system and the low prices. Of course,
there is nothing wrong with low prices when the emission cap is fixed like in the EU ETS, because low prices imply that abating emissions is cheap (which is a good thing). The Market Stability Reserve (MSR)
changes the rules of the ETS and the [most recent update](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/revision_en) to the MSR is the biggest change of all: it implies that some of the permits transferred to
the MSR reserve will be permanently cancelled. This happens when the amount of permits in the reserve is greater than the amount of auctioned permits in the previous year, and when
this is true, these extra permits are cancelled. And they are never seen again. What this means is that the cumulative cap is no longer fixed.  

Even though the cap is not fixed anymore the cumulative number of permits is still bounded from above by the orginal cumulative cap as the permits can only be cancelled. At first
this sounds good at least from the environmental point of view as the above MSR cancellation policy could decrease the cumulative emissions. But this could backfire as 
[Beck and Kruse-Anderssen](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-020-00518-w) explain in their nice paper about possible consequences of the revision:

>"Electrification of industries that today use
fossil fuels and that are not covered by the EU ETS – mainly transport and private heating
installations – increase the demand for electricity. Since the overwhelming majority of
plants that use fossil fuels to generate electricity are covered by the EU ETS, electrification
increases the demand for allowances. This leads to a reduction of the allowance surplus
and thereby to a reduction in MSR allowance absorption. As a consequence, short-run
emissions as well as long-run cumulated emissions increase, as fewer allowances are cancelled
within the MSR. As electrification of transport and private heating hold substantial
potentials for reducing carbon emissions, this may have severe adverse effects."

What they also write is that the new rules make cost-benefit analyses of national policies very complex because the analyst must anticipate future developments of allowance surplus and many
other factors. But what this means is that the policy makers also face similar problems as they review and (re)design the ETS rules. 

For sure, the designers of the EU ETS have asked 
the question in the title before making this update to the MSR. One certainly hopes so. Current discussion 
in Finland on climate policy revolves strongly around the EU ETS, the role of forests and transportation, but the consequences of national and EU-level
climate policies that aim at least-cost solutions are becoming more and more difficult to understand due to everchanging rules and uncertainty.
