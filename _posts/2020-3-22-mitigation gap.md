I asked my wife the other day if we should have our third child, and the immediate response was "Yeah, sure. But after 
the birth I'll be on a holiday for a year - so, have fun".
Perhaps that's all for the best, as now my annual CO$$_2$$ emissions are, in fact, *negative*. Or at least they would be if I believe
this [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta): *The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions* by Seth Wynes
and Kimberly Nicholas. The authors have calculated among other things that one transatlantic flight less implies about 1.5
tonnes CO$$_2$$-equivalent emission reduction, and that having one fewer child implies whopping 58.6 tonnes CO$$_2$$-equivalent emission reduction per year (average value in developed countries).
The latter one is a lot of emission reduction given that average per capita emissions for a Finn are around less than 10 tonnes. So, I'm happy that my annual emissions are now negative...

But seriously, the paper has received a lot of attention probably 
exactly due to this result. What does it mean that having one fewer child implies 58.6 tonnes CO$$_2$$-equivalent emission reduction per year?
And how do Wyles and Nicholas obtain their figure(s) for this emission reduction? They write on page 2 that

>For the action 'have one fewer child,' we relied on a study which quantified future emissions of descendants based on historical rates, based on heredity [(Murtaugh and Schlax 2009)](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/population_and_sustainability/pdfs/OSUCarbonStudy.pdf). 
>In this approach, half of a child's emissions are assigned to each parent, as well as one quarter of that child's offspring (the grandchildren) and so forth. 

You probably can guess what comes next, right? Philippe van Basshuysen and Eric Brandstedt have written a [comment](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aab213), which, 
dissappointingly, has not received much media coverage compared to the paper. It never will. They write that 

>It is important to point out the obvious here: GHG emissions are mainly and directly caused by burning of fossil fuels, everything else just makes that more or less likely. If one is attributing responsibility—as one is when making normative recommendations in government documents and textbooks—the focus should be on actions that are under the control of the individual agent and which, with a significant probability, contribute to the undesired outcome. It is not clear that the decision to have a child falls under this category of actions.

and that

>the members of a generation X are fully responsible for the emissions of their successive generation, Y (and in fact, of all successive generations), though the members of Y are also fully responsible for their own emissions. Hence, the analysis invokes multiple counting of shares of responsibility for emissions: for a given generation, every preceding generation is fully responsible for that generation's emissions.

I find it difficult to object to this conclusion about the methodology and the related double-counting. Moreover, their latter point raises a somewhat symmetrical problem: If I'm responsible for the "bad" behaviour of my offspring, am I not also responsible for their "good" behaviour? For example, let's 
suppose both of my children decide to have one fewer child (assuming also that they can commit to this decision). This means that annual emissions drop (by 58.6 tonnes?) for each of them, and in effect, so do mine because half of the reduction goes
to me and half to their mother. And this would all be achieved not by my own actions but by my childrens'. I think it would be more straightfoward to focus on "lifestyle choices"  that are directly 
related to fossil fuel use like the number of flights per year or car type. 

In addition, one should remember why we care about "the climate problem": it has a high potential to decrease the welfare of the current and, moreover, of the future generations. (Sure, there are other reasons, 
but welfare is probably the most significant reason).
Having less children comes with a trade-off: even if it would be true that emissions decrease by this action, so does the aggregate happiness or welfare. So, how would you value
the annual reduction of 58.6 tonnes? And the cost of having one less citizen in our society?
