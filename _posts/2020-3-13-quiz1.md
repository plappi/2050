The following passage is from an old economics textbook. Can you guess when it was written?

> "Global natural resource use has been an area of concern for economists since the simultaneous births of modern economics and industrial society in the eighteenth century.
Malthus was concerned with land and food contraints choking off population growth and the well-being of individuals. Conservationists and the contemporary neo-Malthusians
such as [_name omitted_], the ecologist, and [_name omitted_], the system analyst, have addressed the same issues not from dissimilar perspectives. Today newspapers and public affairs 
television programs remind us regularly of impending oil exhaustion, fish stock declines, the increase of carbon dioxide in the athmosphere, the destruction of forests, the land
constraints on the world food production, and the rapidly growing populations and cities of the Third World."

   In the 80s. The book is The Economics of Natural Resource Use by John Hartwick and Nancy Olewiler. It was published in 1986 - back then I was 5 years old.

A similar book published today could well begin with the same text. Except for oil exhaustion. I wonder how a book published in 2050 begins?
